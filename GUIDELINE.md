# Guidelines for creating problems

This is a general guideline on how to create problems. The structure of this repository is crucial for the automated scripts to work.

The current structure is as follows:

```
problems/
├─ <websive>/
│  ├─ <problem_id>/
│  │  ├─ <solution>.<language>
```

A filled example would be:

```
problems/
├─ leetcode/
│  ├─ 125/
│  │  ├─ solution.cpp
```
