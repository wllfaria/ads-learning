# Coding problems

This repository contains almost every algorithm problem I've solved on various
platforms, from Leetcode to Codeforces. You will find the solutions in various
languages as a lot of the times I use those problems to also learn something
about a new language. Although most of the time I'll try to use Rust, but
sometimes its just really weird to solve certain problems with Rust so in those
cases you can expect Javascript, C++ or something else that I'm interested at
the moment.
