If you just got here wondering what is this, this is a repository dedicated to learn and practice algorithms and data structures. Aswell as many other computer science related topics. This is still in a very early stage, as I myself am going through this path.

Please [refer to the project section](https://github.com/users/wllfaria/projects/2) for a comprehensive list of topics with resources to learn and practice exercises attached.
